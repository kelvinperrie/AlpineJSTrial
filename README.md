this is a test of alpine.js, potentially as a replacement for knockout.js. Does not require any preprocessing of js, just add the script to the page and it will work - i.e. can be added direct to a .net MVC or razor page

deployed here https://alpinetrialkp.netlify.app/

this project shows:
* binding of js properties to the text and/or html of page elements
* conditional visibility of html
* looping over a js array to generate multiple html elements
* removing and adding of items to a js array which are automatically reflected on the page
* conditional styling of html elements based on js properties
* has the entire js model as a single object
